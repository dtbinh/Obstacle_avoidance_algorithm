Obstacle_avoidance_algorithm
============================
The code proposes a simulation for obstacle avoidance in a robot using a unicycle model. Various parameters of the origin, destination, obstacle co-ordinates, obstacle clearance can be edited in the code.
Two conditions while editing:
1. Change obstacle co-ordinates in the both m files.
2. Be sure that the obstacle lies between the origin and the final destination, as the code is exclusively created for the purpose of obstacle avoidance.

Run the gotogoal_withobstacle.m for the simulation.
